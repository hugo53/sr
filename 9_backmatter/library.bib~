abstract = {In recent years, social media has become ubiquitous and important for social networking and content sharing. And yet, the content that is generated from these websites remains largely untapped. In this paper, we demonstrate how social media content can be used to predict real-world outcomes. In particular, we use the chatter from Twitter.com to forecast box-office revenues for movies. We show that a simple model built from the rate at which tweets are created about particular topics can outperform market-based predictors. We further demonstrate how sentiments extracted from Twitter can be further utilized to improve the forecasting power of social media.},

abstract = {Online social media are complementing and in some cases replacing person-to-person social interaction and redefining the diffusion of information. In particular, microblogs have become crucial grounds on which public relations, marketing, and political battles are fought. We introduce an extensible framework that will enable the real-time analysis of meme diffusion in social media by mining, visualizing, mapping, classifying, and modeling massive streams of public microblogging events. We describe a Web service that leverages this framework to track political memes in Twitter and help detect astroturfing, smear campaigns, and other misinformation in the context of U.S. political elections. We present some cases of abusive behaviors uncovered by our service. Finally, we discuss promising preliminary results on the detection of suspicious memes via supervised learning based on features extracted from the topology of the diffusion networks, sentiment analysis, and crowdsourced annotations.},

In the context of the 2009 German federal election, we conducted a sentiment analysis of over 100,000 messages containing a reference to either a political party or a politician. Our results show that Twitter is used extensively for political deliberation and that the mere number of party mentions accurately reflects the election result. The tweets’ sentiment (e.g., positive and negative emotions associated with a politician) corresponds closely to voters’ political preferences. In addition, party sentiment profiles reflect the similarity of political positions between parties. We derive suggestions for further research and discuss the use of microblogging services to aggregate dispersed information.},

abstract = {Twitter is an electronic medium that allows a large user populace to communicate with each other simultaneously. Inherent to Twitter is an asymmetrical relationship between friends and followers that provides an interesting social network like structure among the users of Twitter. Twitter messages, called tweets, are restricted to 140 characters and thus are usually very focused. We investigate the use of Twitter to build a news processing system, called TwitterStand, from Twitter tweets. The idea is to capture tweets that correspond to late breaking news. The result is analogous to a distributed news wire service. The difference is that the identities of the contributors/reporters are not known in advance and there may be many of them. Furthermore, tweets are not sent according to a schedule: they occur as news is happening, and tend to be noisy while usually arriving at a high throughput rate. Some of the issues addressed include removing the noise, determining tweet clusters of interest bearing in mind that the methods must be online, and determining the relevant locations associated with the tweets.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing amount of information flowing through Social Media forces the members of these networks to compete for attention and influence by relying on other people to spread their message. A large study of information propagation within Twitter reveals that the majority of users act as passive information consumers and do not forward the content to the network. Therefore, in order for individuals to become influential they must not only obtain attention and thus be popular, but also overcome user passivity. We propose an algorithm that determines the influence and passivity of users based on their information forwarding activity. An evaluation performed with a 2.5 million user dataset shows that our influence measure is a good predictor of URL clicks, outperforming several other measures that do not explicitly take user passivity into account. We also explicitly demonstrate that high popularity does not necessarily imply high influence and vice-versa.},

abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/asi.21149.abs In this paper we report research results investigating microblogging as a form of electronic word-of-mouth for sharing consumer opinions concerning brands. We analyzed more than 150,000 microblog postings containing branding comments, sentiments, and opinions. We investigated the overall structure of these microblog postings, the types of expressions, and the movement in positive or negative sentiment. We compared automated methods of classifying sentiment in these microblogs with manual coding. Using a case study approach, we analyzed the range, frequency, timing, and content of tweets in a corporate account. Our research findings show that 19\% of microblogs contain mention of a brand. Of the branding microblogs, nearly 20\% contained some expression of brand sentiments. Of these, more than 50\% were positive and 33\% were critical of the company or product. Our comparison of automated and manual coding showed no significant differences between the two approaches. In analyzing microblogs for structure and composition, the linguistic structure of tweets approximate the linguistic patterns of natural language expressions. We find that microblogging is an online tool for customer word of mouth communications and discuss the implications for corporations using microblogging as part of their overall marketing strategy.},

Even though a lot of information is shared in Twitter, little is known yet about how and why certain information spreads more widely than others. In this paper, we examine a number of features that might affect retweetability of tweets. We gathered content and contextual features from 74M tweets and used this data set to identify factors that are significantly associated with retweet rate. We also built a predictive retweet model. We found that, amongst content features, URLs and hashtags have strong relationships with retweetability. Amongst contextual features, the number of followers and followees as well as the age of the account seem to affect retweetability, while, interestingly, the number of past tweets does not predict retweetability of a user's tweet. We believe that this research would inform the design of sensemaking and analytics tools for social media streams.},

Surveys are popular methods to measure public perceptions in emergencies but can be costly and time consuming. We suggest and evaluate a complementary “infoveillance” approach using Twitter during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Our study aimed to: 1) monitor the use of the terms “H1N1” versus “swine flu” over time; 2) conduct a content analysis of “tweets”; and 3) validate Twitter as a real-time content, sentiment, and public attention trend-tracking tool.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Between May 1 and December 31, 2009, we archived over 2 million Twitter posts containing keywords “swine flu,” “swineflu,” and/or “H1N1.” using Infovigil, an infoveillance system. Tweets using “H1N1” increased from 8.8\% to 40.5\% (R2 = .788; p},

Trending topics, the most talked about items on Twitter at a given point in time, have been seen as an opportunity to generate traffic and revenue. Spammers post tweets containing typical words of a trending topic and URLs, usually obfuscated by URL shorteners, that lead users to completely unrelated websites. This kind of spam can contribute to de-value real time search services unless mechanisms to fight and stop spammers can be found. In this paper we consider the problem of detecting spammers on Twitter. We first collected a large dataset of Twitter that includes more than 54 million users, 1.9 billion links, and almost 1.8 billion tweets. Using tweets related to three famous trending topics from 2009, we construct a large labeled collection of users, manually classified into spammers and non-spammers. We then identify a number of characteristics related to tweet content and user social behavior, which could potentially be used to detect spammers. We used these characteristics as attributes of machine learning process for classifying users as either spammers or nonspammers. Our strategy succeeds at detecting much of the spammers while only a small percentage of non-spammers are misclassified. Approximately 70\% of spammers and 96\% of non-spammers were correctly classified. Our results also highlight the most important attributes for spam detection on Twitter},

In particular, we analyze the activity related to the 2010 earthquake in Chile and characterize Twitter in the hours and days following this disaster. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary study of certain social phenomenons, such as the dissemination of false rumors and confirmed news. We analyze how this information propagated through the Twitter network, with the purpose of assessing the reliability of Twitter as an information source under extreme circumstances. Our analysis shows that the propagation of tweets that correspond to rumors differs from tweets that spread news because rumors tend to be questioned more than news by the Twitter community. This result shows that it is posible to detect rumors by using aggregate analysis on tweets.},

abstract = {The popularity of microblogging platforms, such as Twitter, renders them valuable real-time information resources for tracking various aspects of worldwide events, e.g., earthquakes, political elections, etc. Such events are usually characterized in microblog posts via the use of hashtags (). As microbloggers come from different backgrounds, and express themselves in different languages, we witness different translations of hashtags which, however, are about the same event. Language-dependent variants of hashtags can possibly lead to issues in content-analysis. In this paper, we propose a method for translating hashtags, which builds on methods from information retrieval. The method introduced is source and target language independent. Our method is desirable, either instead of, or complimentary, to the direct translation of the hashtag for three reasons. First we return a list of hashtags on the same topic, which takes into account the plurality and variability of hashtags used by microbloggers for assigning posts to a topic. Second, our framework accounts for the problem that microbloggers in different languages will refer to the same topic using different tokens. Finally, our method does not require special preprocessing of hashtags, reducing barriers to real-world implementation. We present proof-of-concept results for the given Spanish hashtag 33mineros.},

abstract = {Advances in didgital technology and a rapidly evolving media landscape continue to dramatically change teaching and learning. Among these changes is the emergence of multimedia teaching and learning tools, online degree programs, and hybrid classes that blend traditional and digital content delivery. At the same time, visual communication programs that are traditionally print-centric have had to make room for Web design and multimedia storytelling courses, as well as technical skills development. To add parsimony to these two areas of study, we chornicle how a blended model has been introduced in a required, 100-level visual communication course through a longitudinal study that followed 174 students through two versions of the same course, one that used blended leanring strategies and one that participated in a more traditional method of course delivery. In combining an analysis of statemtns made by the participants in weekly journals (n=13,552) and the data gathered through a survey (n=174), we compared reactions between the two groups. Additionally, qualitative data from the journals was used to fully explicate the reactions students had to the course. This study sheds light on the effectiveness of a blended modle in the context of students' enjoyment, engagement, and perceived learning outcomes. The results revealed that the blened model was in no way different from the traditional course in terms of engagement and attachment. Journal data revealed students in the blended sections were significantly less negative about the course material, personal achievement, technology, and their emotional reactions than their tradtional counterparts. Additionally, statements made by studetns regarding the issue of rear of the course and problems regarding technology substantially faded over the 15-week semester. Our overall findigns indicate that students are able to adapt well to the technology and processes that make blended learning different from traditional classroom learning. Implications for pedagogy and future research are discussed.},

It may result in permanent damage to academic career. This paper provides advice how to prevent or treat this condition. METHODS: Prepare your manuscript following the IMRaD principle (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion), with every part supporting the key message. When writing, be concise. Clearly state your methods here, while data belong to Results. Successful submissions combine quality new data or new thinking with lucid presentation. RESULTS: Provide data that answer the research question. Describe here most important numeric data and statistics, keeping in mind that the shorter you can present them, the better. The scientific community screens abstracts to decide which full text papers to read. Make your point with data, not arguments. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions have to be based on the present study findings. The time of lengthy and unfounded speculations is over. A simple message in a clearly written manuscript will get noticed and may advance our understanding of stroke.},

Recent mathematical developments and user-friendly computer programmes for visualising and measuring networks have led to significant advances in quantitative SNA. Amidst these developments, however, there have been calls for the revival of qualitative approaches to social networks, not necessarily to supplant quantitative methods, but to complement them. Quantitative approaches map and measure networks by simplifying social relations into numerical data, where ties are either absent or present. They therefore bracket out questions of crucial importance to understanding the kinds of human interaction networks studied by social scientists. Qualitative approaches, on the other hand, enable analysts to consider issues relating to the construction, reproduction, variability and dynamics of complex social ties.},

For example, the cuases of political behavior are said to differ greatly from the cuases of sexual behavior or consumer behaviour. (...) In this book we advocate a very different approach. (...) Thus, the theory we will describe is designed to explain virtually any human behavior, whether we want to understand why a person bought a new car, voted against a shool bond issue, was abscent form work, or engaged in premarital sexual intercourse." p.5: "Generally speaking, the theory is based on the assumption that human beings are usually quite rational and make systematic use of the information available to them. We do not subscribe to the view that human social behaviour is controlled by unconscious motives or overpowering desires (...). Rather, we argue that people consider the implications of their actions before they decide to engage or not engage in a given behavior. For this reason we refer to our approach as 'a theory of reasoned action' (...). p.8: "Note that although the theory of reasoned action makes reference to a person's attitude toward the behaviour, it does not include such traditional attitudes as attitudes toward object, people, or institutions. Our emphasis on attitudes toward behaviors, at the expense of attitudes toward objects or targets, questions a fundamental assumption underlying much research on social behavior." p. 9: "Although we regocnize the potential imprtance of such factors attitudes toward targets, perosnality traits, and demographic characteristics, they do not constitute an integral part of our theory but are instead considered to be external variables. From our point of view, external variables may influence the beliefs a person holds or the relative importance he attaches to attitudinal and normative considerations." (...) "One of the major disadvantages of relying on external variables to explain behavior is that differnet kinds of external variables have to be invoked for differnt behavioral domains." p.81: "According to the theory of reasoned action, behavioral change is ultimately the reslut of changes in beliefs. This implies that in order to influence behavior, we have to expose people to information which will produce changes in their beliefs." (...) Changing one or more belifs may not be sufficient to bring about change in the overall attitude. Similarly, changing one or two normative beliefs may have little effect on the subjective norm (...). If neither the attitude nor the subjective norm changes, we cannot expect a shange in behavior." And copnnections attitude-intention and intention-behavior cannot be ytaken for granted.

abstract = {From the Publisher:With advanced computer technologies and their omnipresent usage, data accumulates in a speed unmatchable by the human's capacity to process data. To meet this growing challenge, the research community of knowledge discovery from databases emerged. The key issue studied by this community is, in layman's terms, to make advantageous use of large stores of data. In order to make raw data useful, it is necessary to represent, process, and extract knowledge for various applications. Feature Selection for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining offers an overview of the methods developed since the 1970's and provides a general framework in order to examine these methods and categorize them. This book employs simple examples to show the essence of representative feature selection methods and compares them using data sets with combinations of intrinsic properties according to the objective of feature selection. In addition, the book suggests guidelines for how to use different methods under various circumstances and points out new challenges in this exciting area of research. Feature Selection for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining is intended to be used by researchers in machine learning, data mining, knowledge discovery, and databases as a toolbox of relevant tools that help in solving large real-world problems. This book is also intended to serve as a reference book or secondary text for courses on machine learning, data mining, and databases.},

abstract = {Users on Twitter, a microblogging service, started the phenome- non of adding tags to their messages sometime around February 2008. These tags are distinct from those in other Web 2.0 systems because users are less likely to index messages for later retrieval. We compare tagging patterns in Twitter with those in Delicious to show that tagging behavior in Twitter is different because of its conversational, rather than organizational nature. We use a mixed method of statistical analysis and an interpretive approach to study the phenomenon. We find that tagging in Twitter is more about filtering and directing content so that it appears in certain streams. The most illustrative example of how tagging in Twitter differs is the phenomenon of the Twitter micro-meme: emergent topics for which a tag is created, used widely for a few days, then disappears. We describe the micro-meme phenomenon and discuss the importance of this new tagging practice for the larger real-time search context.},

abstract = {In this paper we report research results investigating microblogging as a form of electronic word-of-mouth for sharing consumer opinions concerning brands. We analyzed more than 150,000 microblog postings containing branding comments, sentiments, and opinions. We investigated the overall structure of these microblog postings, the types of expressions, and the movement in positive or negative sentiment. We compared automated methods of classifying sentiment in these microblogs with manual coding. Using a case study approach, we analyzed the range, frequency, timing, and content of tweets in a corporate account. Our research findings show that 19\% of microblogs contain mention of a brand. Of the branding microblogs, nearly 20\% contained some expression of brand sentiments. Of these, more than 50\% were positive and 33\% were critical of the company or product. Our comparison of automated and manual coding showed no significant differences between the two approaches. In analyzing microblogs for structure and composition, the linguistic structure of tweets approximate the linguistic patterns of natural language expressions. We find that microblogging is an online tool for customer word of mouth communications and discuss the implications for corporations using microblogging as part of their overall marketing strategy.},

@article{Rowlands2010,
abstract = {Web search engines discover indexable documents by recursively 'crawling' from a seed URL. Their rankings take into account link popularity. While this works well, it introduces biases towards older documents. Older documents are more likely to be the target of links, while new documents with few, or no, incoming links are unlikely to rank highly in search results. We describe a novel system for 'new-Web' search based on links retrieved from the Twitter micro-blogging service. The Twitter service allows individuals, organisations and governments to rapidly disseminate very short messages to a wide variety of interested parties. When a Twitter message contains a URL, we use the Twitter message as a description of the URL's target. As Twitter is frequently used for discussion of current events, these messages offer useful, up- to-date annotations and instantaneous popularity readings for a small, but timely, portion of the Web. Our working system is simple and fast and we believe may offer a significant advantage in revealing new information on the Web that would otherwise be hidden from searchers. Beyond the basic system, we anticipate the Twitter messages may add supplementary terms for a URL, or add weight to existing terms, and that the reputation or authority of each message sender may serve to weight both annotations and query-independent popularity.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy 
use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently 
and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full 
text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ 
To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of 
millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of 
millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, 
very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in 
technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three 
years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the 
first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling 
traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved 
with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This 
paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the 
additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal 
with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

abstract = {Twitter—a microblogging service that enables users to post messages (“tweets”) of up to 140 characters—supports a variety of communicative practices; participants use Twitter to converse with individuals, groups, and the public at large, so when conversations emerge, they are often experienced by broader audiences than just the interlocutors. This paper examines the practice of retweeting as a way by which participants can be “in a conversation.” While retweeting has become a convention inside Twitter, participants retweet using different styles and for diverse reasons. We highlight how authorship, attribution, and communicative fidelity are negotiated in diverse ways. Using a series of case studies and empirical data, this paper maps out retweeting as a conversational practice.},

abstract = {Information needs tell us why search terms are used, helping to disambiguate, for example, what exactly people are looking for with queries such as Orange or Java. It is hard to understand goals and motivations, however, from the keywords entered into search engines alone. This paper discusses the pilot analysis of 180,000 tweets, containing search-related terms, to try and understand how people describe their own needs and goals. The early analysis shows that some terms academically associated with searching behaviours were infrequently used by twitter users, and that the use of terminology varied depending on the subject of search. The results also show that specific topics of searching tasks can be identified directly within tweets. Future analysis of the still on-going 5-month study will constitute more formal text analytical methods and try to build a corpus of real search tasks.},

abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

This paper addresses the issue on collective intelligence retrieval with activated knowledge-base decision making. Our methodology differs from the existing literature in the sense that we are doing analysis on Twitter microblog messages as opposed to traditional blog analysis in the literature which deals with the conventional 'blogosphere'. Another key difference in our methodology is that we apply visualization techniques in conjunction with artificial intelligence-based data mining methods to classify messages dealing with the trend topic. Our methodology also analyzes demographics of the authors of such Twitter messages and attempt to map a Twitter trend into what's going on in the real world. Our findings reveal a pattern behind trends on Twitter, enabling us to see how it 'ticks' and evolves though visualization methods. Our findings also enable us to understand the underlying characteristics behind the 'trend setters', providing us a new perspective on the contributors of a trend.},

As compared to a traditional web search engine, where the challenge lies in finding the right document to satisfy a user’s information need, the challenge in a social search engine like Aardvark lies in finding the right person to satisfy a user’s information need. Further, while trust in a traditional search engine is based on authority, in a social search engine like Aardvark, trust is based on intimacy. We describe how these considera- tions inform the architecture, algorithms, and user interface of Aardvark, and how they are reflected in the behavior of Aardvark users.},

@article{Zhao2009,
abstract = {Micro-blogs, a relatively new phenomenon, provide a new communication channel for people to broadcast information that they likely would not share otherwise using existing channels (e.g., email, phone, IM, or weblogs). Micro-blogging has become popu-lar quite quickly, raising its potential for serving as a new informal communication medium at work, providing a variety of impacts on collaborative work (e.g., enhancing information sharing, building common ground, and sustaining a feeling of connectedness among colleagues). This exploratory research project is aimed at gaining an in-depth understanding of how and why people use Twitter - a popular micro-blogging tool - and exploring micro-blog's poten-tial impacts on informal communication at work.},

abstract = {A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known--a collaboration network and a food web--and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},
